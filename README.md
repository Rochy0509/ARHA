# Autonomous Retirement Home Assistant (ARHA)

> [!NOTE]  
> Under development currently


This is the official repository for ARHA. A capstone project developed by students at Ontario Tech University, with the primary goal of creating an autonomous robot to assist in retirement homes by automating repetitive tasks that staff must perform.

Current Tasks:
 - Development of the finger sensor code.
To be create:
 - Improvement of previous robotic arm code to be a binamual with robust control system using ROS2 Humble
 - Incorporation of Lerobot_ros for RL training
 - Data acquisition mechanism interface (human to robot)
 - Development of robot base navigation and task scheduling

Current Software team:
 - Kenneth Martinez (ROS2, Moveit2, Lerobot_ros)
 - Riley Workman (Finger sensor and support)
 - Khalil Balde (Robot Base motor control, Nav2, Sensors)
